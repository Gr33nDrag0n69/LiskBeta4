# Prepare a backup node for Validator/Generator.

Once your 2nd server lisk-core node is functional and in sync with network.
These are the commands to quickly copy encrypted keys & hash onion seeds on the backup node.
Take note that even if the "Last Block Info" are also transferred, they will be invalid (on server 2) as soon as another block is generated on server 1.
The process to safely switch active server (after this procedure will be done) is available [here]().

## Get Required Files from **Server 1**

1. Export Generator Info.
```shell
lisk-core generator:export -o "$HOME/server1-generator-export.json"
lisk-core endpoint:invoke random_getHashOnionSeeds > "$HOME/server1-hashonionseeds-export.json"
```

2. Show File Content & Inspect all look fine.
```shell
cat "$HOME/server1-generator-export.json"
cat "$HOME/server1-hashonionseeds-export.json"
```

3. Download files.

4. Delete files.
```shell
rm -f "$HOME/server1-generator-export.json"
rm -f "$HOME/server1-hashonionseeds-export.json"
```

## Configure **Server 2**

1. Upload exported files to HOME directory.

2. Show current generator info
```shell
lisk-core generator:export
```

3. Import Generator Info (Encrypted Keys & Last Block Info)
```shell
lisk-core generator:import -f "$HOME/server1-generator-export.json"
```

4. Show updated generator info
```shell
lisk-core generator:export
```

5. Show current HashOnionSeeds
```shell
lisk-core endpoint:invoke random_getHashOnionSeeds --pretty
```

6. Import HashOnionSeeds

**Note:**
If you get ` â€º   Error: Response not received in 3000ms` message(s) during import, don't stress, it probably worked anyway.
Just go to step 7 and check updated local config.

```shell
for JsonParams in $( cat "$HOME/server1-hashonionseeds-export.json" | jq -rc '.seeds[]'); do
    lisk-core endpoint:invoke random_setHashOnion "$JsonParams"
done
```

7. Show current HashOnionSeeds
```shell
lisk-core endpoint:invoke random_getHashOnionSeeds --pretty
```

8. Delete file.
```shell
rm -f "$HOME/server1-generator-export.json"
rm -f "$HOME/server1-hashonionseeds-export.json"
```

## Other Task(s)

* Delete the copy of the files on the computer you used to transfer them.
